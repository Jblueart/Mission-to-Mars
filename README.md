# Mission-to-Mars

My goal is to create a website that gathers information from various sources about Mars & is able to update to find new information at the click of a button. 
I created a database on a partition on my pc in order to run and test the website while working on fine tuning it. 

Method: Jupyter notebooks to build the scraping application. Translated to Javascript in order to run the app via interactive website built with html. 
At the click of a button a new scrape is pulled, the information downloaded to my database mars_app via MongoDB. And the website is updated to show some statistics about Mars as well as images. 

## Working Images!

Goal is to make it look great using bootstrap css styling. 
## First iteration, note Mongo running in VSCode which is integral to the process. 
Even the folder order and information was important to consider. Learning to see how the websites are built and are created.

Parsing Json data to retreive the chuncks that are relevant to our project is so specific, but I'm glad to better understand the process now. 
Defining variables & passing anonymous functions to sift thru the information is an excercise in patience. I hope it gets easier with time.
